## My current abilities in cubing

I have decided to use the original rubik's cube because I have one at home and want the challenge of learning to solve it

I cannot currently solve it

![(I will be using this basic algorithm I have found)(https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0MjYyNzAyNzY2NTY1MjQ0/rubik-cube-algorithms.png)]
