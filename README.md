## My current abilities in cubing

## Cube #1
### I have decided to use the original rubik's cube because I have one at home and want the challenge of learning to solve it
### I cannot currently solve it

### I will be using this basic algorithm I have found

## Cube #2
### I will be using the pyraminx as my second cube because it is a lot easier than the original rubik's cube 
### I can solve it
